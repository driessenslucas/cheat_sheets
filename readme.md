## Neural Networks Cheat Sheet

This section provides a guide to setting up common neural network architectures using PyTorch, including:

- **Vanilla Neural Networks**: A basic feedforward neural network architecture.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used primarily for image classification and analysis.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Ideal for sequential data processing.
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)**: A type of RNN that is effective for long-range dependencies.

## Model Evaluation Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet presents various metrics for evaluating machine learning models, including:

- Classification Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC
